1. I chose Java for this exercise because I feel as though I currently have more experience with Java than many other languages. The libraries I chose for this were extremely helpful because using ArrayList, I was able to have a dynamic list that would be able to scale with different sized data sets, using the Timestamp library, I was able to have a universal timestamp format that is comparable so that I was able to sort the transactions by timestamp to better achieve the desired solution. Finally, the Scanner library was extremely useful in being able to read the data from the file
2. Some advantages of my solution are that it is scalable with different sized datasets, as well as being fairly efficient in the retreival of transactions from the dataset using ArrayLists. One disadvantage is that creating multiple object classes for the transactions and the payers could end up using more memory as the dataset gets larger compared to a solution in a different language.
3. Personally, my favorite school project so far has been the first team development project we did in CS400, where we used git to pull and push all of our own code from the main repository on a virtual machine. This was a really cool project because I was able to learn how to effectively use version control and git to increase productivity as a team. However, it was challenging to me at first as I started to familiarize myself with git and the terminal, but as time went on, I became more confident with it, and realized the power of using git while programming, even if you are just an individual.
